# Background

Supplement to Peterson CD. Klibansky N. Vincent MT. Walter III JF.
Climate-readiness of fishery management procedures with application to
the southeast U.S. Atlantic.

This report contains supplementary materials from a South Atlantic MSE
exercise testing the behavior of model-based versus empirical MPs for
black sea bass (BSB), vermilion snapper (VS), and red porgy (RP) using
the openMSE software ([Blue Matter Science](bluematterscience.com)).

This section is focused on results for vermilion snapper.

- Performance metrics (PMs)
  - $dSSB_{0}$ - dynamic spawning stock biomass that would occur under
    no fishing pressure
  - $F_{MSY}$ - the rate of fishing mortality ($F$) that would produce
    MSY
  - $SSB_{MSY}$ - SSB that would produce MSY if fished at $F_{MSY}$
  - $SSB_{y}$ - SSB in the year $y$
  - SSBratio - The ratio of SSB to dynamic SSB that would be achieved in
    the absence of fishing ($dSSB_{0}$) calculated annually
  - t10SSBratio - Mean terminal 10 years of SSBratio; SSBratio
    calculated annually over the final 10 years of the projection period
    and averaged across years 40-50
  - Fratio - The ratio of realized fishing mortality ($F$) to the rate
    that would produce MSY ($F_{MSY}$) calculated annually
  - PNOF - Probability of not overfishing, calculated as the proportion
    of years that $F/F_{MSY}$ exceeds 1 for the 50-year projection
    period of each projection iteration
  - P100 - Proportion of years in the final 10 years of the simulation
    period (years 40-50) in which SSB\>SSBMSY for each projection
    iteration
  - cyield - Cumulative relative yield, where relative yield is
    calculated as realized yield relative to OM-defined MSY (i.e., if
    yield = MSY, then relative yield = 1 for that year) summed across
    all 50 projected years
  - AAVY - Annual average variability in yield, calculated as the
    average change in yield from year-to-year across all years of the
    projection period:
    $AAVY= \Sigma_{t=0}^{t=50} sqrt( (((yield_{t}-yield_{t-1}) / (yield_{t-1} ))^{2}) )$
